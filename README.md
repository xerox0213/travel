## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of an exam. The focus was on demonstrating solid Laravel backend development skills within a limited time frame. Please note that the original database provided during the exam is not available, and as such, the project may not be fully functional without it. However, the codebase reflects the quality and functionality expected.
